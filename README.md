In this project, the native java types were pigeonholed into classes in order to access them in an easier
way in the future, since here they will be differentiated from the native java types by calling them Scrabble types.
At the moment this project has 2 main functions. The first one is about take Scrabble types and give them the ability to
transform into another Scrabble types as possible.
The second function is the ability to operate between the different Scrabble types, being able to be added,
subtracted, multiplied, divided and operated according to logical operators according to each case.
