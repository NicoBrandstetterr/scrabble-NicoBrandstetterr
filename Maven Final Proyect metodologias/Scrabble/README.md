In this project, native Java types were pigeonholed into classes for easier future
access. as here they will be differentiated from native Java types by calling them
Scrabble types. Currently, this project has 4 main functions. The first one is about
taking Scrabble types and giving them the ability to morph into as many other Scrabble
types as possible. The second function is the ability to operate between the different
types of Scrabble, being able to add, subtract, multiply, divide and operate according
to logical operators according to each case. The third Function, added in the current
installment of homework 2, was given the ability for the program to be able to build and 
evaluate an AST using the types and operations defined in the previous functions. The 4th
function was the implementation of a functionality that allows the program to store the values
that have been created so that it does not have to create them again.
